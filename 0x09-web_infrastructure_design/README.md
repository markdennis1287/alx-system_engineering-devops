# Web infrastructure design
  
This project is about designing a robust, scalable, and efficient web infrastructure. In the context of DevOps and s    ystem administration, you will learn to create and explain the architecture of a web stack. This includes understand    ing and implementing various components like DNS, web servers, load balancers, and monitoring systems to ensure high     availability and reliability.

## Concepts

For this project, the are the concepts to loo at:

 -DNS
 -Monitoring
 -Web Server
 -Network basics
 -Load balancer
 -Server
 
 ## Learning Objectives
 
 1. Draw a diagram illustrating the components of a web stack, showing how they interact with each other.
 2. Describe the function and purpose of each component in the web stack, such as DNS servers, web servers, and load     balancers.
 3. Explain concepts like system redundancy and how it prevents single points of failure (SPOF) to ensure high availa    bility and reliability.
 4. Understand and explain acronyms such as:
         LAMP - Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
         SPOF - Single Point of Failure
         QPS - Queries Per Second
